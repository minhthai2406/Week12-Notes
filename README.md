## How to save credential in cache for 15 minutes
- This will allowed Git to save your password in memory for some time.
It's important to know that saving credential in Git will save your credential in a text file that is public to everyone to view, therefore setting a cache timeout to delete after a certain period of time is important.

Set git  to use the credential memory cache
```
 git config --global credential.helper cache ```

By default, Git will cache your password for 15 minutes.
You can also set it to 1 hour long by setting cache timeout to 3600.

Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)
```
 git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600' ```

## Change log
- Added credential memory cache
